1. Install the RazorGenerator Visual Studio Extension

2. Add a new, empty MVC project to the Tenants folder.  
	--> (The project will not actually run as an MVC site, but this will give you the proper tooling)

3. Delete the following...App_Data, App_Start, Models, Global.asax, Web.config, Views\Web.config

4. Add a reference to the main Web project, the TenancyCore

5. Add the following Post-Build Events (Adjusted for your physical folder structure)

	%systemroot%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\installutil "$(TargetPath)"
	copy /Y "$(TargetDir)$(TargetName)*.dll" "$(SolutionDir)Web\Tenants\"
	copy /Y "$(TargetDir)$(TargetName)*.pdb" "$(SolutionDir)Web\Tenants\"

6. Add a class with the name of the tenant that inherits from AbstractTenant

7. Set properties on Tenant in the constructor method of the class.



*** To Override Controller Functionality ***

1. Implement a class that inherits from the controller class in the main web project

2. Override the specific action method


*** To Override the View ***

1. Add the view to the appropriate sub-folder in the Views folder

2. Open the "Properties" window for the View and set the Custom Tool to "RazorGenerator"
	--> (This will add a generated *.cs file beneath the view)

3. This will pre-empt the version in the main web project.
